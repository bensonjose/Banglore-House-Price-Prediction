<br><br>
In this project, I have developed a model for predicting house prices in Bangalore area(Real estate price prediction).<br>
This model predicts the price of the house using various features such as location, Number of bedrooms and bathrooms, total area in sqft etc.<br>
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset, performed data cleaning, Feature engineering and developed a Linear regression model to predict the price.<br>
K-folds cross validation was used to check accuracy of the model!<br>
After that, GridSearchCV was used to select the best performing model among lasso and decision tree regression respectively.<br>
For User Interface(UI), I developed a simple website powered by html, CSS and Flask!<br>
